# SudokuJavaFX
Sudoku app implemented with JavaFX.

Hello World! I am Ukodus, a retired software developer that now has time to explore a bit. The last ten years of my career was developing in .NET and SQL Server (Windows). I will now be exploring Java on an iMac (OSX) and Raspberry Pi (Linux). I chose Java for a number of reasons: write once run anywhere, maturity of the language, the huge support community, Oracle's commitment to improvements, nice free tools, and it's new to me so I am curious.

My goal here is to learn and have fun, not to sell software. I am going to start with a simple one-player puzzle game, Ukodus, which is Sudoku spelled backwards. This will limit the project scope while I gain experience with the Java universe. I have some half-baked ideas for an app that would assist math students... a sort of virtual graph paper that supports various coordinate systems. Another idea is an app that plots, scales, and prints airfoils... I love flying RC sailplanes. When I was a kid there was a toy called "SpiroGraph" which made really cool designs based on the mathematical notion of epicycloids, and it just begs to be automated. I have more ideas but you can probably see how these relate... some math, some graphics, and some fun.

Of course, being retired, I reserve the right to work as much or as little as I want.

Enough! Time to begin, -- Ukodus 11-15-2016
